## How to Use Dagger to Manage This Project

Dagger is an open-source runtime for composable, containerized workflows-ideal for orchestrating complex, multi-component systems. Below is a step-by-step guide to integrating Dagger with Orange Lab which is basically advanced CI scaffolding.

---

### **1. Install Dagger CLI and SDK**

- **Install the Dagger CLI:**
  ```sh
  curl -L https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | sh
  ```
  Or use Homebrew:
  ```sh
  brew install dagger/tap/dagger
  ```
- **Add the Dagger SDK for Node.js:**
  In your project root:
  ```sh
  npm install @dagger.io/dagger
  ```
  Then you should run:

  ```dagger init --sdk=typescript```
  This sets up the expected structure and dagger.json.
  Without this, Dagger can’t find your modules.

  You may also wish to disable telemetry out of the box and add this to your shell rc file:

  ```export DO_NOT_TRACK=1```

---

### **2. Initialize Dagger in Your Project**

- **Create a `.dagger` directory** in your project root (if you want to keep Dagger modules or workflows organized).
- **Initialize a Dagger pipeline file** (e.g., `dagger.ts` or `dagger-workflow.ts`) at the root.

---

### **3. Define Your Dagger Pipeline**

You’ll want to codify your workflows (build, test, lint, deploy) as Dagger pipelines. Here’s a minimal example for a TypeScript/Node.js project using Pulumi:

```typescript
// dagger-workflow.ts
import { connect } from "@dagger.io/dagger";

export default async function main() {
  // Connect to Dagger engine
  const client = await connect();

  // Define a container for Node.js tasks
  const node = client.container()
    .from("node:20")
    .withMountedDirectory("/src", client.host().directory("."))
    .withWorkdir("/src");

  // Install dependencies
  const deps = await node
    .withExec(["npm", "ci"])
    .stdout();

  // Lint
  const lint = await node
    .withExec(["npm", "run", "lint"])
    .stdout();

  // Test
  const test = await node
    .withExec(["npm", "run", "test"])
    .stdout();

  // Pulumi preview
  const preview = await node
    .withExec(["npx", "pulumi", "preview", "--diff"])
    .stdout();

  // Pulumi up (deployment)
  // Uncomment to enable deployment
  // const deploy = await node
  //   .withExec(["npx", "pulumi", "up", "--yes"])
  //   .stdout();

  console.log({deps, lint, test, preview});
}

main();
```

### **4. Run Your Dagger Pipeline**

- **Execute the workflow:**
  ```sh
  dagger run node dagger-workflow.ts
  ```
  This will run your defined steps in a reproducible, containerized environment.

---

### **5. Extend and Modularize**

- **Break out workflows**: You can create multiple workflow files for different tasks (e.g., `dagger-lint.ts`, `dagger-deploy.ts`).
- **Use Dagger modules**: If you want to share steps or logic, create modules in `.dagger` and import them.
- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Run `dagger run ...` in your CI pipeline for reproducible builds and deployments.

---

### **6. Advanced: Compose with Other Languages or Tools**

Dagger’s universal type system lets you compose workflows across languages (e.g., Rust, Python, Go) and reuse steps, which is ideal if you want to extend your stack beyond Node.js.

---

### **7. Observability and Caching**

- **Artifact caching**: Dagger caches outputs of each operation, so repeated runs are fast and efficient.
- **Observability**: Use Dagger’s built-in tracing and logs to debug and optimize your workflows.

---

### **8. Real-World Example: Pulumi + Dagger**

- **Pulumi preview and deploy**: Run Pulumi commands in the Dagger workflow as shown above.
- **Custom build steps**: Add Docker builds, static analysis, or custom scripts as needed.
- **Parallelism**: Dagger can run independent steps in parallel for speed.

### **Summary Table: Dagger Integration Steps**

| Step                  | Command/Action                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Install CLI/SDK       | `brew install dagger/tap/dagger` & `npm i @dagger.io/dagger` |
| Create workflow file  | `dagger-workflow.ts` in project root               |
| Define workflow       | Use Dagger SDK to script build/test/deploy         |
| Run workflow          | `dagger run node dagger-workflow.ts`               |
| Extend/compose        | Modularize workflows, use `.dagger` modules        |

**If you choose to use dagger for your CI, you now have a reproducible, modular, and observable workflow engine** If you want a more advanced, multi-language pipeline or need to integrate with your AI/LLM workflows, Dagger’s universal type system and module system make it easy to extend.
