Nextcloud is a self-hosted productivity platform that lets you store files, collaborate, and run office apps in your own private cloud.

It can also be used to store your contacts, bookmarks, calendar etc. and has a lot of additional modules which can be installed through the deployed website.

### Basic configuration

```sh
# Enable Nextcloud
pulumi config set nextcloud:enabled true
# Set hostname (optional, default: nextcloud)
pulumi config set nextcloud:hostname nextcloud
# Set storage size (default: 20Gi)
pulumi config set nextcloud:storageSize 50Gi
# Set storage size for PostgreSQL database (default: 5Gi)
pulumi config set nextcloud:storageSize 10Gi
# (Optional) Set admin password, auto-generated by default
pulumi config set nextcloud:adminPassword abcd1234 --secret
pulumi up
```

Log in as `admin` and create a new user at:

`https://nextcloud.<domain>/settings/admin`

### Storage

Nextcloud uses a persistent volume for file storage. You can expand the volume as needed. To keep data but disable the app:

```sh
pulumi config set nextcloud:storageOnly true

# Keep the database engine running (use this for DB maintanance)
pulumi config set nextcloud:db/enabled true
pulumi up
```

### Access

After deployment, access Nextcloud at:

```sh
https://nextcloud.<domain>/
```

Login with the admin user. The password can be retrieved with:

```sh
pulumi stack output --show-secrets --json | jq '.office.nextcloudUsers.admin' -r
```

### Database

Nextcloud uses a MariaDB database to store its data, which is managed by the MariaDB Operator.

When restoring from a backup, the auto-generated passwords will not match the ones stored in the database and `config/config.php`. To prevent this mismatch, you should set the passwords explicitly after the initial install. This ensures that the application can connect to the database with the correct credentials after the restore.

```sh
# Get the nextcloud user password from Pulumi stack output
pulumi stack output --show-secrets --json | jq '.office.nextcloud.db.password' -r

# Set password for the nextcloud user
pulumi config set nextcloud:db/password YourNextcloudDbPassword --secret

# Set password for the mariadb root user
./scripts/mariadb-password.sh nextcloud

pulumi up
```

### Upgrade

After updating Nextcloud it could enter _maintanace mode_.

In that case run the upgrade inside the container:

```sh
# enter the container
./scripts/exec.sh nextcloud

./occ upgrade

# Optional
./occ maintenance:mode --off
```

### Resetting admin password

If you lose the admin password, you can reset it. This is also helpful after restoring from backup and new password has been generated.

1.  Get a shell inside the Nextcloud container using the `exec.sh` script.

    ```sh
    ./scripts/exec.sh nextcloud
    ```

2.  Once inside the container's shell, run the `occ` command to reset the password for the `admin` user. Replace `YourNewPassword` with a strong password.

    ```sh
    ./occ user:resetpassword admin YourNewPassword
    ```

3.  Exit the container shell.

4.  (Recommended) Update the password in Pulumi config so it matches the one stored by Nextcloud. This helps restoring backups so the password is not auto-generated again.

    ```sh
    pulumi config set nextcloud:adminPassword YourNewPassword --secret
    ```

### Pika Backup

Pika Backup is a simple backup utility that can use Nextcloud as a remote backup destination via WebDAV. This allows you to store your local backups in your private cloud.

To configure Pika Backup with Nextcloud as a remote location:

1.  Install Pika Backup on your client machine.
2.  Select "Remote Location" as the backup destination.
3.  Use the following URL format:
    ```
    dav://<user>@nextcloud.<domain>/remote.php/webdav/
    ```
4.  Enter your Nextcloud username and password when prompted.

This will allow Pika Backup to access your Nextcloud storage for automated backups.
