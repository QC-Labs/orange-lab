Cert-manager is a Kubernetes certificate management controller that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.

It is installed automatically when AMD GPU operator is enabled.

```sh
pulumi config set cert-manager:enabled true
pulumi up
```

## Custom domains

Cert-manager can be used to manage SSL certificates for your custom domain using Let's Encrypt.

You will need to create a `ClusterIssuer` depending on your DNS provider.

Currently only DNS challenges are supported, as HTTP require a public endpoint and at this point only private ones on Tailnet can be created.

You can find supported providers at https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/

### CloudFlare

For example, to use CloudFlare you need to create an API token (https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) then create a `ClusterIssuer` using this token and DNS solver.

```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: cloudflare-api-secret
    namespace: cert-manager
type: Opaque
stringData:
    api-token: <cloudflare_api_token>

---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-issuer # referenced in Pulumi.yaml, you can override it with cert-manager:clusterIssuer
    namespace: cert-manager
spec:
    acme:
        server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        # server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        email: <valid_email>
        privateKeySecretRef:
            name: letsencrypt-account-key
        solvers:
            - dns01:
                  cloudflare:
                      apiTokenSecretRef:
                          name: cloudflare-api-secret
                          key: api-token
              selector:
                  dnsZones:
                      - <your_custom_domain_name>
```

Save this as `cloudflare.yml` replacing `cloudflare_api_token`, `valid_email` and `your_custom_domain_name`.

Use `kubectl apply -f cloudflare.yml` to create the issuer.

It's recommended to start with `acme-staging-v02` server to make sure everything works as expected, then switch to production `acme-v02` server to generate valid certificates. This helps to avoid getting throttled when configuration is incorrect.

More information at https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/

Note the examples use `Issuer` which is namespace scoped but we'll use `ClusterIssuer` to create certificates in all related namespaces.

## Uninstall

To uninstall cert-manager and clean up its custom resource definitions:

```sh
pulumi config set cert-manager:enabled false
pulumi up

kubectl delete crd \
  certificaterequests.cert-manager.io \
  certificates.cert-manager.io \
  challenges.acme.cert-manager.io \
  clusterissuers.cert-manager.io \
  issuers.cert-manager.io \
  orders.acme.cert-manager.io
```
